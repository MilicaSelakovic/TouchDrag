    <string name="description_selection">By entering this mode a user can change which points of the triangle are free. Points can be marked as free (green), as candidates to become free (yellow) or as points which cannot become free points in the active configuration (red). Tapping a green point will change its color to yellow and by tapping yellow it will become green. Red points may become yellow in some other configurations, by turning some green points to yellow.</string>

For instance, if the drawn line is close to an altitude of an existing triangle, then the drawn line is updated (docked) to be that altitude, as it was, likely, the intention of the user. In that case, information that line will be recognized as altitude of the triangle is shown.</string>
